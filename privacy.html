                        of our users, to improve the Site, and to develop new products, services, features, and functionality. • We may use your email address or other information we collect to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer
                        service or to send communications, including updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties. <br>• We may use cookies and automatically collected information to: (i) personalize
                        our Site, such as remembering information about you so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor
                        and analyze the effectiveness of the Site and third-party marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (v) track your entries, submissions, and status in

                    <p class="mb-4"><b>When We Disclose Information</b><br> Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose information about you that we collect on the Site to third parties without your consent. We may disclose information to third parties
                        if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
                        <br>• Any information that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area of the Site will be available to anyone who has access to that content, including other users.
                        <br>• We work with third party service providers to provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, printing, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process information about you as
                        part of providing those services for us.
                        <br>• We may disclose information about you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws, in response to a court order, judicial or other government
                        subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.
                        <br>• We also reserve the right to disclose information about you that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to: (i) take precautions against liability; (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive,
                        or unlawful uses or activity; (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Site and any facilities or equipment used to make the Site available;
                        or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.
                        <br>• Information about our users may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of
                        an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.
                        <br>• We may make certain aggregated, automatically-collected, or otherwise non-personal information available to third parties for various purposes, including: (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business
                        or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through
                        the Site.
